The things I would blog about include Spirituality, Inclusivity, Meditation and Lyra, my cat. I enjoy speaking about these items because it gives me a platform to potentially help others who may not have as much experience as I do in those subjects. Plus, who doesn't want to read about our animal companions?! Maybe, after creating this website, I will begin to blog and include links to them.</p></div>

   <p style ="text-align: center; background-color:rgb(233, 255, 255);" class="border text-danger">As far as developing, I have an associate's degree in Digital Media Design that focused on front-end developing. Although I spent two years learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is not something I tend to enjoy creating. I am much more interested in back-end developing, hence why I took the C# fullstack bootcamp and not the front-end bootcamp. I enjoy creating via logic and have found myself very excited with what I have learned so far.</p>

   <p style ="text-align: center; background-color: rgb(233, 255, 255);" class="border text-warning">I would consider my hometown to be Oak Park, MI. I have lived in this city for a few years now, and during that time, have noticed my personal growth increase exponentially. Before I lived in Oak Park I lived in Detroit and on the east side, near Grosse Pointe and St. Clair Shores. The area I live now provides me alot of availibility to do the things I want to do. There are many vegan friendly grocery stores, many more small businesses than the east side and lots and lots of trees, which is just delightful. The community I am apart of also lives near the Oak Park area which makes it even more appealing for me to stick around this area. </p></div>
